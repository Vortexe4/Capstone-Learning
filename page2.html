        understanding it. Each time he made the turn, he saw only the white,
        unused, buckling sidewalk, with perhaps, on one night, something
        vanishing swiftly across a lawn before he could focus his eyes or speak.
        But now, tonight, he slowed almost to a stop. His inner mind, reaching
        out to turn the corner for him, had heard the faintest whisper.
        Breathing? Or was the atmosphere compressed merely by someone standing
        very quietly there, waiting? He turned the corner. The autumn leaves
        blew over the moonlit pavement in such a way as to make the girl who was
        moving there seem fixed to a sliding walk, letting the motion of the
        wind and the leaves carry her forward. Her head was half bent to watch
        her shoes stir the circling leaves. Her face was slender and milk-white,
        and in it was a kind of gentle hunger that touched over everything with
        tireless curiosity. It was a look, almost, of pale surprise; the dark
        eyes were so fixed to the world that no move escaped them. Her dress was
        white and it whispered. He almost thought he heard the motion of her
        hands as she walked, and the infinitely small sound now, the white stir
        of her face turning when she discovered she was a moment away from a man
        who stood in the middle of the pavement waiting. The trees overhead made
        a great sound of letting down their dry rain. The girl stopped and
        looked as if she might pull back in surprise, but instead stood
        regarding Montag with eyes so dark and shining and alive, that he felt
        he had said something quite wonderful. But he knew his mouth had only
        moved to say hello, and then when she seemed hypnotized by the
        salamander on his arm and the phoenix-disc on his chest, he spoke again.
        "Of course," he said, "you're a new neighbour, aren't you?" "And you
        must be"-she raised her eyes from his professional symbols-"the
        fireman." Her voice trailed off. "How oddly you say that." "I'd-I'd have
        known it with my eyes shut," she said, slowly. "What-the smell of
        kerosene? My wife always complains," he laughed. "You never wash it off
        completely." "No, you don't," she said, in awe. He felt she was walking
        in a circle about him, turning him end for end, shaking him quietly, and
        emptying his pockets, without once moving herself. "Kerosene," he said,
        because the silence had lengthened, "is nothing but perfume to me."
        "Does it seem like that, really?" "Of course. Why not?" She gave herself
        time to think of it. "I don't know." She turned to face the sidewalk
        going toward their homes. "Do you mind if I walk back with you? I'm
        Clarisse McClellan." "Clarisse. Guy Montag. Come along. What are you
        doing out so late wandering around? How old are you?" They walked in the
        warm-cool blowing night on the silvered pavement and there was the
        faintest breath of fresh apricots and strawberries in the air, and he
        looked around and realized this was quite impossible, so late in the
        year. There was only the girl walking with him now, her face bright as
        snow in the moonlight, and he knew she was working his questions around,
        seeking the best answers she could possibly give. "Well," she said, "I'm
        seventeen and I'm crazy. My uncle says the two always go together. When
        people ask your age, he said, always say seventeen and insane. Isn't
        this a nice time of night to
