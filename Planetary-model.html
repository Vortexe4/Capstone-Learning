          The Planetary Model says that electrons move around the center of an
          atom at the nucleus, like planets orbiting the Sun. These paths are
          called orbits. Electrons stay in one of the orbits, and their energy
          stays the same while they are there. Electrons can absorb or release
          energy as light when they move to different orbits.
