        "I rarely watch the 'parlour walls' or go to races or Fun Parks. So I've
        lots of time for crazy thoughts, I guess. Have you seen the
        two-hundred-foot-long billboards in the country beyond town? Did you
        know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started
        rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it
        would last." "I didn't know that!" Montag laughed abruptly. "Bet I know
        something else you don't. There's dew on the grass in the morning." He
        suddenly couldn't remember if he had known this or not, and it made him
        quite irritable. "And if you look"-she nodded at the sky-"there's a man
        in the moon." He hadn't looked for a long time. They walked the rest of
        the way in silence, hers thoughtful, his a kind of clenching and
        uncomfortable silence in which he shot her accusing glances. When they
        reached her house all its lights were blazing. "What's going on?" Montag
        had rarely seen that many house lights. "Oh, just my mother and father
        and uncle sitting around, talking. It's like being a pedestrian, only
        rarer. My uncle was arrested another time-did I tell you?-for being a
        pedestrian. Oh, we're most peculiar." "But what do you talk about?" She
        laughed at this. "Good night!" She started up her walk. Then she seemed
        to remember something and came back to look at him with wonder and
        curiosity. "Are you happy?" she said. "Am I what?" he cried. But she was
        gone-running in the moonlight. Her front door shut gently. "Happy! Of
        all the nonsense." He stopped laughing. He put his hand into the
        glove-hole of his front door and let it know his touch. The front door
        slid open. Of course I'm happy. What does she think? I'm not? he asked
        the quiet rooms. He stood looking up at the ventilator grille in the
        hall and suddenly remembered that something lay hidden behind the
        grille, something that seemed to peer down at him now. He moved his eyes
        quickly away. What a strange meeting on a strange night. He remembered
        nothing like it save one afternoon a year ago when he had met an old man
        in the park and they had talked .... Montag shook his head. He looked at
        a blank wall. The girl's face was there, really quite beautiful in
        memory: astonishing, in fact. She had a very thin face like the dial of
        a small clock seen faintly in a dark room in the middle of a night when
        you waken to see the time and see the clock telling you the hour and the
        minute and the second, with a white silence and a glowing, all certainty
        and knowing what it has to tell of the night passing swiftly on toward
        further darknesses but moving also toward a new sun. "What?" asked
        Montag of that other self, the subconscious idiot that ran babbling at
        times, quite independent of will, habit, and conscience. He glanced back
        at the wall. How like a mirror, too, her face. Impossible; for how many
        people did you know that refracted your own light to you? People were
        more often-he searched for a simile, found one in his work-torches,
        blazing away until they whiffed out. How rarely did other people's faces
        take of you and throw back to you your own expression, your own
        innermost trembling thought? What incredible power of identification the
        girl had; she was like the eager watcher of a marionette show,
        anticipating each flicker of an eyelid, each gesture of his hand, each
        flick of a finger, the moment before it began. How long had they walked
        together? Three minutes? Five?
