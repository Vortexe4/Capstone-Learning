          1. All matter is composed of atoms, which cannot be split or
          destroyed.<br />
          2. Atoms of the same element are identical in terms of size, mass, and
          properties, while atoms of different elements are distinct.<br />
          3. Atoms from different elements combine in fixed, simple whole-number
          ratios to form compounds.<br />
          4. Atoms remain unchanged when a compound breaks down; they are not
          created or destroyed.<br />
          5. During chemical reactions, atoms are rearranged, combined, or
          separated.
