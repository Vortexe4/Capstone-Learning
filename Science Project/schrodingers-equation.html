          Schrödinger’s Equation helps us understand how electrons move inside
          atoms. It is mainly used for atoms with only one electron, like
          hydrogen. The equation helps us figure out the different energy levels
          the electron can have. Instead of thinking of the electron as a tiny
          particle, Schrödinger thought of electrons as a wave. The wave shows
          where the electron is most likely to be in the atom, but it doesn’t
          show an exact spot. This idea works well for simple atoms, but it's
          harder for bigger atoms because they have more electrons and
          complicated interactions.
