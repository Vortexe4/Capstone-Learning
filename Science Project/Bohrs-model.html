          Bohr’s Model shows that all electrons circle the nucleus of an atom in
          a pattern, like how planets circle the Sun. The electrons are arranged
          in specific patterns by energy levels or shells. The shells are named:
          the K shell is closest to the nucleus and holds 2 electrons, the L
          shell holds 8 electrons, the M shell holds 18 electrons, and so on.
          Electrons can absorb or emit radiation when they jump between allowed
          states. Atoms are most stable when their outer shell is full,
          according to Bohr’s model. The "octet rule" refers to the number of
          electrons, which is often eight.
