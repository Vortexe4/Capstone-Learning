        Yet how large that time seemed now. How immense a figure she was on the
        stage before him; what a shadow she threw on the wall with her slender
        body! He felt that if his eye itched, she might blink. And if the
        muscles of his jaws stretched imperceptibly, she would yawn long before
        he would. Why, he thought, now that I think of it, she almost seemed to
        be waiting for me there, in the street, so damned late at night ... . He
        opened the bedroom door. It was like coming into the cold marbled room
        of a mausoleum after the moon had set. Complete darkness, not a hint of
        the silver world outside, the windows tightly shut, the chamber a tomb-
        world where no sound from the great city could penetrate. The room was
        not empty. He listened. The little mosquito-delicate dancing hum in the
        air, the electrical murmur of a hidden wasp snug in its special pink
        warm nest. The music was almost loud enough so he could follow the tune.
        He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over, and down on itself like a
        tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and
        now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness. He was not happy. He was not
        happy. He said the words to himself. He recognized this as the true
        state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run
        off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock
        on her door and ask for it back. Without turning on the light he
        imagined how this room would look. His wife stretched on the bed,
        uncovered and cold, like a body displayed on the lid of a tomb, her eyes
        fixed to the ceiling by invisible threads of steel, immovable. And in
        her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an
        electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talk coming
        in, coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind. The room was indeed
        empty. Every night the waves came in and bore her off on their great
        tides of sound, floating her, wide-eyed, toward morning. There had been
        no night in the last two years that Mildred had not swum that sea, had
        not gladly gone down in it for the third time. The room was cold but
        nonetheless he felt he could not breathe. He did not wish to open the
        curtains and open the french windows, for he did not want the moon to
        come into the room. So, with the feeling of a man who will die in the
        next hour for lack of air,.he felt his way toward his open, separate,
        and therefore cold bed. An instant before his foot hit the object on the
        floor he knew he would hit such an object. It was not unlike the feeling
        he had experienced before turning the corner and almost knocking the
        girl down. His foot, sending vibrations ahead, received back echoes of
        the small barrier across its path even as the foot swung. His foot
        kicked. The object gave a dull clink and slid off in darkness. He stood
        very straight and listened to the person on the dark bed in the
        completely featureless night. The breath coming out of the nostrils was
        so faint it stirred only the furthest fringes of life, a small leaf, a
        black feather, a single fibre of hair. He still did not want outside
        light. He pulled out his igniter, felt the salamander etched on its
        silver disc, gave it a flick.... Two moonstones looked up at him in the
        light of his small hand-held fire; two pale moonstones buried in a creek
        of clear water over which the life of the world ran, not touching them.
        "Mildred ! " Her face was like a snow-covered island upon which rain
        might fall; but it felt no rain; over which clouds might pass their
        moving shadows, but she felt no shadow. There was only the singing of
        the thimble-wasps in her tamped-shut ears, and her eyes all glass, and
        breath going in
