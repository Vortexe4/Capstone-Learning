        walk? I like to smell things and look at things, and sometimes stay up
        all night, walking, and watch the sun rise." They walked on again in
        silence and finally she said, thoughtfully, "You know, I'm not afraid of
        you at all." He was surprised. "Why should you be?" "So many people are.
        Afraid of firemen, I mean. But you're just a man, after all..." He saw
        himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of bright water,
        himself dark and tiny, in fine detail, the lines about his mouth,
        everything there, as if her eyes were two miraculous bits of violet
        amber that might capture and hold him intact. Her face, turned to him
        now, was fragile milk crystal with a soft and constant light in it. It
        was not the hysterical light of electricity but-what? But the strangely
        comfortable and rare and gently flattering light of the candle. One
        time, when he was a child, in a power-failure, his mother had found and
        lit a last candle and there had been a brief hour of rediscovery, of
        such illumination that space lost its vast dimensions and drew
        comfortably around them, and they, mother and son, alone, transformed,
        hoping that the power might not come on again too soon .... And then
        Clarisse McClellan said: "Do you mind if I ask? How long have you worked
        at being a fireman?" "Since I was twenty, ten years ago." "Do you ever
        read any of the books you bum?" He laughed. "That's against the law!"
        "Oh. Of course." "It's fine work. Monday bum Millay, Wednesday Whitman,
        Friday Faulkner, burn 'em to ashes, then bum the ashes. That's our
        official slogan." They walked still further and the girl said, "Is it
        true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start
        them?" "No. Houses. have always been fireproof, take my word for it."
        "Strange. I heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by
        accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames." He laughed. She
        glanced quickly over. "Why are you laughing?" "I don't know." He started
        to laugh again and stopped "Why?" "You laugh when I haven't been funny
        and you answer right off. You never stop to think what I've asked you."
        He stopped walking, "You are an odd one," he said, looking at her.
        "Haven't you any respect?" "I don't mean to be insulting. It's just, I
        love to watch people too much, I guess." "Well, doesn't this mean
        anything to you?" He tapped the numerals 451 stitched on his char-
        coloured sleeve. "Yes," she whispered. She increased her pace. "Have you
        ever watched the jet cars racing on the boulevards down that way?
        "You're changing the subject!" "I sometimes think drivers don't know
        what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly," she
        said. "If you showed a driver a green blur, Oh yes! he'd say, that's
        grass! A pink blur? That's a rose-garden! White blurs are houses. Brown
        blurs are cows. My uncle drove slowly on a highway once. He drove forty
        miles an hour and they jailed him for two days. Isn't that funny, and
        sad, too?" "You think too many things," said Montag, uneasily.
