        FAHRENHEIT 451 by Ray Bradbury This one, with gratitude, is for DON
        CONGDON. FAHRENHEIT 451: The temperature at which book-paper catches
        fire and burns PART I IT WAS A PLEASURE TO BURN IT was a special
        pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed. With
        the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its
        venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his
        hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the
        symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal
        ruins of history. With his symbolic helmet numbered 451 on his stolid
        head, and his eyes all orange flame with the thought of what came next,
        he flicked the igniter and the house jumped up in a gorging fire that
        burned the evening sky red and yellow and black. He strode in a swarm of
        fireflies. He wanted above all, like the old joke, to shove a
        marshmallow on a stick in the furnace, while the flapping pigeon-winged
        books died on the porch and lawn of the house. While the books went up
        in sparkling whirls and blew away on a wind turned dark with burning.
        Montag grinned the fierce grin of all men singed and driven back by
        flame. He knew that when he returned to the firehouse, he might wink at
        himself, a minstrel man, burnt- corked, in the mirror. Later, going to
        sleep, he would feel the fiery smile still gripped by his face muscles,
        in the dark. It never went away, that. smile, it never ever went away,
        as long as he remembered. He hung up his black-beetle-coloured helmet
        and shined it, he hung his flameproof jacket neatly; he showered
        luxuriously, and then, whistling, hands in pockets, walked across the
        upper floor of the fire station and fell down the hole. At the last
        moment, when disaster seemed positive, he pulled his hands from his
        pockets and broke his fall by grasping the golden pole. He slid to a
        squeaking halt, the heels one inch from the concrete floor downstairs.
        He walked out of the fire station and along the midnight street toward
        the subway where the silent, air-propelled train slid soundlessly down
        its lubricated flue in the earth and let him out with a great puff of
        warm air an to the cream-tiled escalator rising to the suburb.
        Whistling, he let the escalator waft him into the still night air. He
        walked toward the comer, thinking little at all about nothing in
        particular. Before he reached the corner, however, he slowed as if a
        wind had sprung up from nowhere, as if someone had called his name. The
        last few nights he had had the most uncertain feelings about the
        sidewalk just around the corner here, moving in the starlight toward his
        house. He had felt that a moment before his making the turn, someone had
        been there. The air seemed charged with a special calm as if someone had
        waited there, quietly, and only a moment before he came, simply turned
        to a shadow and let him through. Perhaps his nose detected a faint
        perfume, perhaps the skin on the backs of his hands, on his face, felt
        the temperature rise at this one spot where a person's standing might
        raise the immediate atmosphere ten degrees for an instant. There was no
